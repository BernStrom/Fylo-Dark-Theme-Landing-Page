This project was build on purely HTML and CSS.

## Introduction

The Fylo Landing Page with Dark Theme and Features Grid is a project for practicing website layout and responsive desgin in CSS.

It is a new, separate project build on top of the [Fylo Landing Page with Two Column Layout](https://github.com/BernStrom/Fylo-Landing-Page-with-Two-Column-Layout/ "Fylo Landing Page with Two Column Layout") project. This is an extension version with a different layout design and some additional content added on top of the previous project.

This project was obtained from a list of challenges by Frontend Mentor.

* Use semantic HTML5 markup. *Manage code readability, accessibility and SEO optimization of web page.*

* Style with reusable CSS classes. 

* Use responsive design to make the page compatible on screen across mobile and desktop devices.

* Keep the code as clean as possible.

* Not explicitly required, but hover state features have been added to the navigation menu, submit buttons and social media icons for extra legitimacy effect. Additionally, focus effects are also added to the input fields of the page.

And don't forget the core of it all, _**Happy coding!ðŸš€**_

_P.S:_ _**Hover state features is not applicable on touchscreen devices, as it is only available through hovering over with a mouse cursor.**_
